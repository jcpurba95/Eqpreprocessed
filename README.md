# Eqpreprocessed
This is one simple code to handle preprocessing of seismic broadband data via Obspy.

Everything is written in Python.

The code will apply Obspy's read, pre-filter, decimate, instrument correction to data. 

Further application for the data include detection of earthquake in every file (.miniseed format)
